42
==

A very sophisticated piece of software.
42 isn't nearly finished at this point but once it's finished we plan for it to return the number 42 efficiently.
It's quite complex really.

## Contributing

If you're up for the difficult task and want to help out with the project you may contribute. Simply fork the project
and submit a pull request when finished (add your name/copyright to the top of main.c as well as in contributors.txt).

## Building

To build 42 you can run our state of the art Makefile:

```shell
make
```

Then execute 42:

```shell
./42
```

And to clean the directory:

```shell
make clean
```
